    "# 3. Binary Encoding\n",
    "# Description: Converts categories into binary numbers and then splits the digits into separate columns.\n",
    "# Use Case: Reduces dimensionality compared to one-hot encoding.\n",
    "# Example: Converting {'Red': [0, 0], 'Green': [0, 1], 'Blue': [1, 0]}.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Target Encoding\n",
    "# Description: Replaces categories with the mean of the target variable for each category.\n",
    "# Use Case: Useful for high-cardinality categorical variables.\n",
    "# Example: If predicting house prices, replace neighborhood names with the average house price in each neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Frequency Encoding\n",
    "# Description: Replaces categories with their frequency in the dataset.\n",
    "# Use Case: Captures the importance of categories based on their occurrence.\n",
    "# Example: Converting {'Red': 50, 'Green': 30, 'Blue': 20}.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. Hashing Encoding\n",
    "# Description: Uses a hash function to convert categories into numerical values.\n",
    "# Use Case: Useful for large datasets with many unique categories.\n",
    "# Example: Hash function converts {'Red', 'Green', 'Blue'} into [123, 456, 789].\n",
    "\n",
    "# Each technique has its pros and cons, and the choice depends on the specific dataset and the machine learning algorithm being used."
